                            <h2>THE HISTORY OF EAST ASIAN CALLIGRAPHY</h2>

                            <p>East Asian brush calligraphy closely integrates aspects of art, communication, and
                                symbology, thus offering educators a particularly rich set of resources from which to
                                draw upon. In this article, we start with an overview of brush calligraphy, including
                                its relationship with art, communication, and symbology. We follow with a brief
                                discussion of the historical and contemporary place of brush calligraphy in East Asian
                                education and society; finally, we explore some pragmatic aspects of creating class
                                sessions or even a course on brush calligraphy.</p>

                            <p>As an artistic genre, brush calligraphy holds a central place in the cultural history in
                                East Asia. The form of the characters used in the Chinese writing system—as well as the
                                other writing systems that were derived from it— have long held a place of special
                                regard in the aesthetic traditions of the region. Brush calligraphy has historically
                                been ubiquitous in the visual culture of China, Japan, and Korea, either as a complement
                                to another kind of image (perhaps a landscape painting or part of an illustrated book)
                                or as a work of art in its own right; consequently, it is central to the study of East
                                Asian art history.</p>

                            <p>Chinese calligraphy reached its zeniths during the Jin and Tang Dynasties. Tang Dynasty
                                in particular is praised as the golden age of Chinese culture, with calligraphy as one
                                of its crowning achievements. In the Tang Dynasty the government set up academies for
                                studying calligraphy. Calligraphy was used to asses the talents of a person and was
                                considered as a way for selecting promising candidates.</p>

                            <p>Chinese calligraphy has been divided into five major styles: Zhuan Shu (篆书); which today
                                mostly confined to seal carving, Li Shu (隶书); which is the traditional official style
                                and was mainly dominated the calligraphy style of the Han Dynasty in 206 B.C.-220 A.D,
                                Kai Shu (楷书); which was the most common form of printing, and also constitutes the
                                standard form of Chinese’ writing, Xing Shu (行书); which is the most commonly used form
                                of hand writing also known as ‘running style’ and finally Cao Shu (草书), the Chinese
                                cursive style, mostly used by calligraphers for highly abstract works but also seen in
                                everyday use. All these major forms can be divided further in various sub categories.
                                There are also two earlier styles which are no more in common use and were not
                                originally executed by brush, namely, the Jia Guwen ( 甲骨文) or “oracle bone script” and
                                the Jin Wen (金文) which were characters engraved on bones, shells and bronze, sometimes
                                categorized under Zhuan Shu.</p>

                            <h2>EAST ASIAN ALPHABET</h2>

                            <p>Chinese characters are logograms developed for the writing of Chinese.Chinese characters
                                are the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world. By virtue of their
                                widespread current use throughout East Asia and Southeast Asia, as well as their
                                profound historic use throughout the Sinosphere, Chinese characters are among the most
                                widely adopted writing systems in the world by number of users.</p>

                            <p>The total number of Chinese characters ever to appear in a dictionary is in the tens of
                                thousands, though most are graphic variants, were used historically and passed out of
                                use, or are of a specialized nature. A college graduate who is literate in written
                                Chinese knows between three and four thousand characters, though more are required for
                                specialized fields.</p>

                            <p>In Japan, 2,136 are taught through secondary school (the Jōyō kanji), and hundreds more
                                are in everyday use. Due to separate simplifications of characters in Japan and in
                                China, the kanji used in Japan today has some differences from Chinese simplified
                                characters in several respects. There are various national standard lists of characters,
                                forms, and pronunciations.</p>

                            <p>Simplified forms of certain characters are used in mainland China, Singapore, and
                                Malaysia; traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. In addition,
                                Chinese characters have been adapted to write other East Asian languages, and remain a
                                key component of the Japanese writing system where they are known as kanji.</p>

                            <p>Chinese characters in South Korea, which are known as hanja, retain significant use in
                                Korean academia to study its documents, history, literature and records.</p>

                            <p>Vietnam once used the chữ Hán and developed chữ Nôm to write Vietnamese before turning to
                                a romanized alphabet.</p>

                            <p>In Japan, common characters are often written in post-Tōyō kanji
                                simplified forms, while uncommon characters are written in Japanese traditional forms.
                                During the 1970s, Singapore had also briefly enacted its own simplification campaign,
                                but eventually streamlined its simplification to be uniform with mainland China.</p>

                            <p>In modern Chinese, most words are compounds written with two or more characters. Unlike
                                alphabetic writing systems, in which the unit character roughly corresponds to one
                                phoneme, the Chinese writing system associates each logogram with an entire syllable,
                                and thus may be compared in some aspects to a syllabary. A character almost always
                                corresponds to a single syllable that is also a morpheme.However, there are a few
                                exceptions to this general correspondence, including bisyllabic morphemes (written with
                                two characters), bimorphemic syllables (written with two characters) and cases where a
                                single character represents a polysyllabic word or phrase.</p>

                            <p>Modern Chinese has many homophones; thus the same spoken syllable may be represented by
                                one of many characters, depending on meaning. A particular character may also have a
                                range of meanings, or sometimes quite distinct meanings, which might have different
                                pronunciations. Cognates in the several varieties of Chinese are generally written with
                                the same character. In other languages, most significantly in modern Japanese and
                                sometimes in Korean, characters are used to represent Chinese loanwords or to represent
                                native words independent of the Chinese pronunciation (e.g., kun'yomi in Japanese). Some
                                characters retained their phonetic elements based on their pronunciation in a historical
                                variety of Chinese from which they were acquired. These foreign adaptations of Chinese
                                pronunciation are known as Sino-Xenic pronunciations and have been useful in the
                                reconstruction of Middle Chinese.</p>
